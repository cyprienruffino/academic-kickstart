## Generative models for image generation under physical constraints
  ### [El Hadji Brane Seck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/el-hadji-brane-seck-59b985134)
  June to September 2019
  
  [INSA Rouen](https://www.insa-rouen.fr/), [LITIS lab](https://www.litislab.fr/), France
  
  Developped a CycleGAN-like model for generating physically-realistic polarimetric images under optical constraints. Work eventually published in CVIU (2022)
